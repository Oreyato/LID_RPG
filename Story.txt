1-ROAD TO TOWN
#1
~The light is slowly fading away...~

You are standing still in the middle of a forest. It seems that you were 
doing something before being trapped in the threads of space and time.

Suddently, you life flashes before your eyes. As your mind fills with 
informations, the previous encounter fades away...

You remember that you were going towards Mulnr, the South-Est city.
You take a quick look inside your bag and pockets before going.

The sky is starting to get dark, you should hurry to get out of this
forest, you never know what could happen when even your hands are hard
to see...

Suddently, you hear something on your left. The skilled warrior you are
quickly understand the situation: bandits. Two at least, maybe three.

You tightly hold your weapon, it may be your first fight in a while.
